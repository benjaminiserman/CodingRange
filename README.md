# CodingRange
A fundamentally reworked version of my old tutoring programs.

This is a tutoring program I use to assist in teaching C#.
Important files:
 - Workspace.cs // this is where the student puts their code
 - ProblemList.cs // this file lists all of the problems as well as their test cases
 
 Note: 
 This particular problem list was tailor-made for a specific student.
 The problems have each been flavored to match their sense of humor, and often utilize in-jokes between the two of us.
 If you're not teaching the same person I am, *do not use these problems as they're currently worded*.
